        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          It started on a normal day like any other. Adam was enjoying his days
          as a Plumbing and Mechanical Engineer - designing HVAC and plumbing
          systems for commercial buildings. When not working, he would regularly
          spend his free time playing video games or camping/hiking if the
          weather was nice. But suddenly, everything changed... <br />
          <br />
          Adam was bit by the coding bug! He was consumed by the need to learn
          web development and began making new applications in earnest. Rather
          than let his new found powers go to waste, he donned the mantle of
          Coderman and started his journey into the world of Full Stack
          development.
